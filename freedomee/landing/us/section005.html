                    <h1>Letter from Founder Francesca Giobbi to FreedomeEUsers</h1>
                    <p>A message of Union, Inclusion and Sustainability</p>
                    <p>When we talk about women we are talking about “human empowerment”.</p>
                    <p>The role of women is fundamental for equality to be established, welcoming everyone regardless of gender, race, ideology, social or physical condition, seeking to definitively eliminate inequalities at all levels.</p>
                    <p>We have already seen that we live in a diverse world with immense inequalities aggravated by large economic differences that limit human development in many aspects, thus increasing socioeconomic vulnerability.</p>
                    <p>Promoting entrepreneurship is essential to generate a more inclusive and egalitarian economy that does not limit access to products and services.</p>
                    <p>Change can start with small actions in our own surroundings that promote and encourage opportunities locally or even globally.</p>
                    <p>Community leaders can be facilitators in creating a chain of relationships that integrates, strengthens, and supports one another.</p>
                    <p>Entrepreneurs offering equal opportunities, inclusion, accessibility, training, integrating suppliers and investors to generate profitable and sustainable businesses.</p>
                    <p>Promoting qualification, innovation and management courses is essential to maintain the longevity of companies and to offer more and better services at competitive prices.</p>
                    <p>The task is challenging and needs the support of society as a whole, which together must ensure that everyone has their fundamental rights respected, where people can live better and feel represented.</p>
                    <p>The process is based on guaranteeing equal treatment, without discrimination, without stereotypes, without division.</p>
                    <p>It is to create synergy between all fronts so that they are strengthened and inserted in economic, political, educational and professional life, eliminating physical, economic, cultural, social and technological barriers.</p>
                    <p>The power of transformation is in our hands and in this scenario, the role of women is fundamental, taking the lead in their lives and building a better society. This is your power!</p>
                    <p>“In the history of humanity, good men and women have raised their voices with courage to bring Light to Truth, they have fought to build a more dignified world, with perseverance, strength and compassion.</p>
                    <p>To all of them, anonymous or not, my Gratitude.</p>
                    <p>May Wisdom be given to us so that in the midst of so many challenges, we may have discernment to leave a more Just and Prosperous world.”</p>
                    <p>We are our productivity! Produce with power and compassion.</p>
